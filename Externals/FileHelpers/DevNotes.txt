  The FileHelpers are an easy to use library to import/export data from fixed length or delimited files.
 
  If you want to start using the library go directly to the Quick Start Guide in the CHM.

  Who needs the File Helpers Library ? 
----------------------------------------

  In almost every project there is a need to read/write data from/to a file of a specified format.

  For example for log parsing, data warehouse and OLAP applications, 
  communication between systems, file format transformations 
  (for example from a fixed length to a CSV file).

  This library aims to provide an easy and reliable way to accomplish this task.
